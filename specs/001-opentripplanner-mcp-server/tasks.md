# Tasks: OpenTripPlanner MCP Server – Tasks Index (Split)

## Tasks Index (Split)

This file now serves as an index. Tasks have been split into per-phase markdown documents under `tasks/` for easier navigation and richer spec/doc embedding. Original exhaustive list preserved in git history (see prior commit) for reference.

| Phase | Scope | File |
|-------|-------|------|
| 1 | Setup & Scaffolding (COMPLETE) | `tasks/tasks-phase-1.md` |
| 2 | Test-First RED (COMPLETE) | `tasks/tasks-phase-2.md` |
| 3 | Schemas & Infrastructure Implementation | `tasks/tasks-phase-3.md` |
| 4 | Service Layer | `tasks/tasks-phase-4.md` |
| 5 | Tool Implementations | `tasks/tasks-phase-5.md` |
| 6 | Advanced Enhancements | `tasks/tasks-phase-6.md` |
| 7 | Integration & Performance | `tasks/tasks-phase-7.md` |
| 8 | Documentation & Governance | `tasks/tasks-phase-8.md` |
| 9 | Hardening & Polish | `tasks/tasks-phase-9.md` |

Status: Phases 1 & 2 COMPLETE. Phase 7–9 documentation scaffolds added (NOT STARTED in execution). Phase 3–4 enriched; 5–6 enrichment pending.
