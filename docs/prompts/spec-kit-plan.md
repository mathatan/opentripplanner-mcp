/plan The application is based on a NodeJS template for building MCP servers, maintain the base implementation and extend on it. The application uses pnpm for maintaining minimal number of libraries. Verify the existing libraries before introducing new ones. Use Zod v3 for schemas, Typescript (with Eslint validation), maintain good NodeJS implementation and structure. This implementation should use #file:routing-api.md and #file:geocoding-api.md for specific details on API implementation
