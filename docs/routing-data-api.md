## Overview

The Routing Data API provides datasets and configuration files for building and running OpenTripPlanner (OTP) graphs. It covers public transport, shared mobility, and supporting data for Finland, Estonia, HSL, Southwest Finland, and Waltti regions. Data endpoints supply GTFS, OSM, elevation, rental, parking, POI overlays, and configuration files. Authentication is via API key (`digitransit-subscription-key`). Rate limits and quota restrictions apply. See [API registration](https://digitransit.fi/en/developers/api-registration/) for details.

## Build & Integration Workflow

### Graph Build Pipeline Stages

1. **Ingest**: Collect GTFS, OSM, elevation, rental, parking, POI, fare files.
2. **Preprocess**: Validate, normalize, and check dependencies (e.g., GTFS calendar, OSM timestamp).
3. **Link**: Connect stops to street network, resolve fare zones, rental stations, parking lots.
4. **Index**: Build graph objects, optimize for routing queries.
5. **Publish**: Output graph files (`graph.obj`, zipped artifacts), logs, and version info.

See [OpenTripPlanner data container](https://github.com/HSLdevcom/OpenTripPlanner-data-container) for implementation details.

## Canonical filenames and published artifacts

The data container and the routing-data HTTP server publish a small set of canonical filenames and artifact paths that consumers and automation should expect. These are documented in the captured README snapshot: [`docs/research-snapshots/routing-data-api/2025-09-26T13-14-18-otp-data-container-readme.md`](docs/research-snapshots/routing-data-api/2025-09-26T13-14-18-otp-data-container-readme.md:1).

Common filenames and their meanings:

- `graph-<router>-<commit>.zip` / `graph.zip` — Zipped graph archive produced by the build. Typically contains the serialized graph (`graph.obj`), `version.txt`, `build.log`, and the `report/` directory.
- `router-<router>.zip` / `router-<name>.zip` — Router-specific bundle served by the data server (may include router configs, selected GTFS feeds, and other router-level artifacts).
- `graph.obj` — The OTP serialized graph object that OTP loads for routing queries.
- `otp-config.json` — OTP runtime configuration file (routing, server, and feature toggles).
- `router-config.json` — Data-container router configuration used during the build (feed sources, updaters, filters).
- `version.txt` — Short text file containing build identifier (commit hash, tag, or version string).
- `build.log` — Build output log (stdout/stderr) capturing the build steps and any errors/warnings.
- `report/` — Directory containing validation and QA artifacts (for example `connected.csv`, `unconnected.csv`, `failed_feeds.txt`, and other diagnostics).

These names and layout are used by the local data-server (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/graph-hsl-<commit>.zip`, `http://localhost:8080/router-hsl.zip`) and mirrored by the production endpoints under `https://api.digitransit.fi/routing-data/v3/<router>/`. See the referenced README snapshot for the original examples and exact filenames.

## Configuration Parameter Mapping

| OTP Config Domain      | Example Parameters                  | Dataset Influence      |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Routing defaults      | walkSpeed, bikeSpeed, maxPreTransitTime | GTFS, OSM         |
| Fares                 | fareProducts, fareServiceClasses    | GTFS fare files       |
| Rental                | allowBikeRental, maxBikeRentalDistance | Rental feeds       |
| Parking               | parkAndRide, carDropoff             | Parking data          |
| Realtime ingestion    | enableGTFSRealtime, maxStopTimeDelay| GTFS-RT seeds         |
| Elevation             | elevationBucket, disableElevationProcessing | Elevation raster |
| Filtering             | itineraryFilters, transitGeneralizedCostLimit | All combined   |

## Hosting & Self-Hosting

- **Required datasets**: GTFS, OSM, router-config, build-config.
- **Optional datasets**: Elevation, rental, parking, POI overlays, fare rules.
- **Endpoints**: [Finland](https://api.digitransit.fi/routing-data/v3/finland/), [HSL](https://api.digitransit.fi/routing-data/v3/hsl/), [Varely](https://api.digitransit.fi/routing-data/v3/varely/), [Waltti](https://api.digitransit.fi/routing-data/v3/waltti/).

- **Router index endpoints & listing format**: The router base path (for example `https://api.digitransit.fi/routing-data/v3/<router>/`) may expose published artifacts either as direct file responses or as a directory/index listing. Deployments can differ: some servers present an HTML directory listing (text/html with anchor tags) while others provide a machine-readable JSON index (application/json). Scraping guidance and deployment-specific behaviors:
  - Prefer requesting known filenames (e.g. `graph.zip`, `router-<name>.zip`) directly when possible.
  - Use an HTTP HEAD request first to inspect the `Content-Type` and headers (for example `Content-Length`, `ETag`, `Last-Modified`). Note that some servers (or CDNs) may omit these headers on HEAD or return minimal responses.
  - If `Content-Type: application/json` treat the body as a JSON index and consume file entries; if `Content-Type: text/html` parse anchor tags to extract filenames/URLs. Be prepared for mixed responses (HTML that embeds JSON links or JSON that nests metadata).
  - When neither is definitive, fall back to attempting direct GETs for expected filenames and handle 404/403/429 responses gracefully.
  - Deployment-specific caveats to validate in live environments:
    - Some deployments redirect index requests to a CDN or signed URL (`301`/`302` to auth-preserving endpoints); follow redirects but validate that the API key (if used as query param) is preserved or re-applied as required. NOTE: Live validation required — verify whether production endpoints redirect index GETs and whether query-param auth is retained by redirects.
    - HEAD support is not guaranteed for all endpoints. NOTE: Live validation required — confirm whether HEAD returns the same `Content-Type`, `ETag`, and `Content-Length` as GET for each router endpoint.
    - Range/partial downloads (`Accept-Ranges` / 206 Partial Content) may not be supported for all large artifacts. NOTE: Live validation required when implementing large-file resumption.
    - Some servers provide a JSON index but do not expose file URLs directly (they require a subsequent signed request). NOTE: Live validation required — capture a sample JSON index and the exact retrieval flow for the production endpoint.
    - CORS, TLS certificate chains, and intermediate proxies can introduce different failure modes in client environments (browsers vs. server-side automation). Document expected behavior for your deployment (server-to-server scripts typically avoid CORS issues).
  - Practical scraping guidance:
    - Prefer header-based authentication to limit leakage via logs; if using query param auth, treat it as less secure and validate whether signed/temporary URLs are issued by the server.
    - Implement a tolerant parser: accept both JSON and HTML index formats, and fall back to direct filename GET attempts.
    - Log and surface the raw index response on first run to aid debugging and to create a deterministic scraping example for automation.

- **API key**: Required for production endpoints. See [API registration](https://digitransit.fi/en/developers/api-registration/).
- **Local caching**: Recommended for large datasets and frequent builds.

## Authenticated download examples

When accessing production endpoints use your subscription key. Two common ways to include the API key are via a request header or as a query parameter. Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual subscription key in the example command lines only.

Download a published graph (header auth)

```bash
curl -H "digitransit-subscription-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  "https://api.digitransit.fi/routing-data/v3/finland/graph.zip" \
  -o finland-graph.zip
```

Download a published graph (query param auth)

```bash
curl "https://api.digitransit.fi/routing-data/v3/finland/graph.zip?digitransit-subscription-key=YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -o finland-graph.zip
```

Download a GTFS feed (header auth)

```bash
curl -H "digitransit-subscription-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  "https://api.digitransit.fi/routing-data/v3/finland/feeds/gtfs.zip" \
  -o finland-gtfs.zip
```

Download a GTFS feed (query param auth)

```bash
curl "https://api.digitransit.fi/routing-data/v3/finland/feeds/gtfs.zip?digitransit-subscription-key=YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -o finland-gtfs.zip
```

Note: do not commit real API keys to source control — use environment variables or a secrets manager in automation.

### Fetching Config Files (otp-config.json, router-config.json)

Use the same authenticated download pattern shown above to fetch runtime and router configuration files. Prefer header-based auth for clarity; never commit real keys.

Fetch otp-config.json (header auth)

```bash
curl -H "digitransit-subscription-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  "https://api.digitransit.fi/routing-data/v3/finland/otp-config.json" \
  -o otp-config.json
```

Fetch router-config.json (header auth)

```bash
curl -H "digitransit-subscription-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  "https://api.digitransit.fi/routing-data/v3/finland/router-config.json" \
  -o router-config.json
```

Minimal, validated, and masked example snippets (DO NOT use real secrets)

otp-config.json (example)

```json
{
  "services": {
    "routerId": "finland",
    "server": {
      "baseUrl": "https://otp.example.local",
      "port": 8080
    }
  },
  "security": {
    "digitransit_subscription_key": "REDACTED"
  }
}
```

router-config.json (example)

```json
{
  "router": "finland",
  "feeds": [
    {
      "id": "gtfs-core",
      "url": "https://data.example/finland/gtfs.zip?digitransit-subscription-key=REDACTED"
    }
  ],
  "updaters": [
    {
      "type": "gtfs-rt",
      "url": "https://realtime.example/finland/gtfs-rt",
      "credentials": {
        "apiKey": "REDACTED"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Notes:

- Replace YOUR_API_KEY / REDACTED with secure secrets from environment variables or a secrets manager in automation.
- The snippets are intentionally minimal; real configs include many more OTP-specific fields (graph, routing defaults, transit modes, updaters).

## Performance & Scaling

- **Graph size**: Depends on region and dataset completeness.
- **Memory usage**: Scales with number of stops, links, and POIs.
- **Build duration**: Varies by hardware and dataset size; OSM and GTFS are most impactful.
- **Update cadence**: GTFS daily, OSM weekly/monthly, others as available.
- **Quota/rate limits**: See [API registration](https://digitransit.fi/en/developers/api-registration/#quota-and-rate-limiting).

### Throttling & bulk-download guidance

- Recommended behavior:
  - For automated crawls or bulk downloads (many artifacts or repeated requests), limit metadata/index requests to ~1 request per second. For large binary artifacts (for example `graph.zip` or `gtfs.zip`), introduce a delay of 10–30 seconds between consecutive downloads; start with 10s and increase if you observe throttling.
  - Use HTTP HEAD to inspect `Content-Length` and avoid unnecessary GETs.
  - Honor HTTP 429 responses and the `Retry-After` header. Implement exponential backoff on retries (for example: initial retry after 2s, then 4s, 8s, up to a sensible ceiling such as 60s).
  - Prefer header-based authentication and HTTP keep-alive to reduce connection overhead.
- Bulk download best practices:
  - Mirror only the files required for your build; cache artifacts locally and check `version.txt` (or the file's ETag/Last-Modified) before re-downloading.
  - Limit parallelism for large files (recommended max 2 concurrent large downloads).
  - Stagger scheduled downloads to off-peak hours when possible.
- Contact / quota increases:
  - If you expect sustained high-volume access or repeatedly hit quota limits, request a quota increase or arrange an alternative bulk transfer by contacting the Digitransit team via the API registration page: <https://digitransit.fi/en/developers/api-registration/>.
  - See the captured API registration research snapshot for details and context: [`docs/research-snapshots/routing-data-api/2025-09-26T13-14-18-digitransit-api-registration.md`](docs/research-snapshots/routing-data-api/2025-09-26T13-14-18-digitransit-api-registration.md:1).

## Error & Edge Cases

| Case                             | Trigger Strategy                      | Expected Handling / Notes (including deployment caveats) |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Missing GTFS feed                | Remove one feed                       | Build fails with explicit diagnostics; automation should abort or mark router as degraded. Ensure build logs include `failed_feeds.txt` and surfaced errors. |
| Partial GTFS (no calendar.txt)   | Strip calendar.txt                    | OTP behavior varies by version: some builds substitute default service assumptions while others fail validation. NOTE: Live validation required against target OTP version to confirm behavior. |
| Stale OSM extract                | Use outdated timestamp                 | Warning + possible degraded routing (missing new streets). When behind CDNs, ensure stale cached extracts are refreshed by invalidating CDN caches or versioning filenames. |
| Corrupted elevation              | Provide invalid tile                  | Elevation processing may be skipped or crash the step depending on pipeline robustness — fallback to disabling elevation processing and log the failure. |
| Rental feed timeout / auth error | Simulate network error / invalid key  | Updaters should retry with backoff; consider marking rental availability as partial rather than failing entire build. |
| Fare config mismatch             | Inconsistent zone IDs                 | Fare calculation may be incorrect or cause build-time errors; include validation that cross-checks zone IDs between GTFS and fare config. |
| HEAD not supported / inconsistent headers | Use HEAD to inspect endpoints | Some deployments do not support HEAD or return different headers for HEAD vs GET (missing `ETag`/`Content-Length`). NOTE: Live validation required — confirm HEAD parity before relying on HEAD-only checks. |
| Missing ETag / Last-Modified     | Compare resources across runs         | If absent, rely on `version.txt`, `ETag` from CDN, or `Content-Length`+`Last-Modified` heuristics. NOTE: Live validation required for production endpoint header coverage. |
| Range requests unsupported       | Attempt partial download/resume       | Clients should detect absence of `Accept-Ranges` and fallback to whole-file downloads; implement retry and checksum verification for large artifacts. |
| 429 without `Retry-After`        | Hit rate limit                         | Respect 429; if `Retry-After` missing, implement exponential backoff with jitter and conservative ceiling. |
| 403 vs 401 vs 400 for auth errors | Missing/invalid API key                | Different deployments return different status codes; treat any 4xx auth response as fatal for that request and surface clear diagnostics. NOTE: Live validation required — capture exact status codes for key-protected requests in production. |
| Redirects to signed/special URLs | Index or file request returns 301/302  | Follow redirects but validate that auth is preserved or re-applied; signed URLs may expire quickly. Implement short TTL caching for signed URLs. |
| CDN / cache inconsistency        | Fresh build published but CDN stale    | Use `version.txt` or file-hash checks to detect stale cached artifacts; coordinate cache invalidation during publish windows. |
| TLS / certificate issues         | Expired or incomplete chains          | Automation should surface TLS errors explicitly and avoid silently ignoring them. Add retry hints if proxies intercept TLS. |
| CORS / browser-blocking          | Requests from browser clients         | Routing-data endpoints are typically intended for server-to-server access; do not assume browser-friendly CORS headers. NOTE: Live validation required if you plan browser-based fetches. |
| Corrupted downloaded archive     | Truncated zip / invalid format        | Verify archive integrity (zip sanity + expected files inside). If corrupt, retry download and escalate after N attempts. |
| Build partial success            | Some feeds fail, others succeed       | Publish `report/` artifacts that clearly indicate which feeds failed and allow incremental rebuilds where possible. |
